<h1>The Best Movies According to Christina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>A classic rom-com. Never fails to bring tears to my eyes.</p>
<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>
  Everyone has a favourite cartoon and mine happens to be an ogre as the
  protaginist. The second because the cameos were a chef's kiss.
</p>
<h3>Acrimony</h3>
<p>
  One of Tyler Perry's best work because I believe it depicted what most people
  would feel or react if they were in the same predicament.
