<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Christina. Born and raised in South Africa to Ethiopian immigrants. I grew
  up in an Orthodox Christian household so every day starts and ends with a
  prayer filled with gratitude.

<p>
  From an early age, I realised my love for learning whether it be reading a
  dictionary during my lunch breaks at school (which led to me later doing
  spelling bees) or staying afterschool to help my friends in younger grades
  with their math problems. Whatever seems to catch my interest (and believe me,
  it doesn't take much effort), I grow a hunger to learn all that I can about it
  and try to be as unbiased on the topic as I can be.
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I am currently learning web development and touching on photography
  and video editing as movies fascinate me more in a sense of the color grading
  and angles certain shots were obtained as opposed to how attractive the male
  lead is.
